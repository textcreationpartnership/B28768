            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly offer'd to the Honourable House of COMMONS, AGAINST <hi>Laying a farther Duty upon PAPER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO lay a Duty upon Home-made Paper will greatly discourage the Manufacture of it in <hi>England,</hi> whatever may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the contrary by Private Persons, for their own Ends. Experience shews, That the greatest part of this Duty will be spent in the Salaries of Commissioners and other Officers to levy it. The Value of all the Paper made in the Kingdom not amounting to above 30000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to Forein Paper, (altho the High Duty of 25 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> be now expired) 'tis still extreamly Dear: the true Reason of which is this, There being now a Duty of 60<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> upon <hi>French</hi> Paper, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> using that Paper themselves, which they buy at a Low Rate, do sell us their own at a very great Price; well knowing, that we cannot Import <hi>French</hi> Paper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying a Duty of 45 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more than we do for theirs.</p>
            <p>The Dearness of Paper is the only occasion that a great Number of Voluminous and Useful Books, in many Sciences, now ready for the Press, cannot be Printed; to the great Discouragement of Trade, as well as of Industry and Learning, very many of the Profession being forc'd to employ themselves on trivial Pamphlets. And if a farther Duty should be laid upon Paper, it is too visible, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> will certainly carry away the best part of the Trade of Printing from us; towards which they have already made so great a Progress; by reason that <hi>French</hi> Paper (which is most proper for Printing) imported into <hi>Holland,</hi> pays no more Duty than One Penny <hi>per</hi> Ream: and supposing the intended farther Duty of 30<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> be laid upon it, we shall pay above 4<hi>s. per</hi> Ream for the same: So that no use can be made in <hi>England</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Paper, unless, instead of loading it with Additional Duties, which conveys all the Profit of it to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it shall be thought reasonable to reduce the Duty to that upon all other Forein Paper; by which the <hi>English</hi> will still pay Two Shillings for what the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay but One Penny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore 'tis humbly hoped, that this Honourable House will consider, how destructive the intended Duty will inevitably be to the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of Paper and Printing in</hi> England, <hi>to the total Ruine of a great Number of Families, whose sole Dependence is upon the Paper-Trade, which hath already suffered so much by the Scarcity and Dearness of Paper. And that your Honours will be pleased, either wholly to lay aside the said intended Duty, or else to allow Paper to be imported from all Parts beyond the Seas at an equal Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That two Thirds of the Paper used for Printing and Common Writing, which is rated in our Book of Rates at 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per Ream,</hi> doth cost beyond Sea no more than from 1 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> to 3 <hi>s. per Ream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Produce of the Paper-Duty, from <hi>March</hi> 1. 1696, to <hi>March</hi> 1. 1698, came but to 16848 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d</hi> about one Third whereof was collected upon the Stock which was in the Hands of Tradesmen before and at the time when the Act pass'd.</p>
